# JavaJdbcDemo
This is my first attempt at building a project structure in Github - bear with me :)

I am a java developer trying to learn JDBC DAO implementation using Spring Framework.

I am using Apache Derby database.

To run the application, download all .java classes and the spring.xml file. The main class is the BankDemo.java class. It
uses the different commands that are either commented out or in use. You can comment out any lines you want and run the app. 

I am also in the process of loading all the jars needed to run the app.
