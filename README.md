# JavaJdbcDemo
I am a java developer trying to learn JDBC DAO implementation using Spring Framework

To run the application, download all .java classes and spring.xml files. The main class is the BankDemo.java class. It
uses the different commands that are either commented out or in use. You can comment out any lines you want and run the app. 

This project assumes you have set up a database using Apache Derby and have installed the Spring Framework.
